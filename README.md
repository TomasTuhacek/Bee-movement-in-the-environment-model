# Bee-movement-in-the-environment-model-
Model of movement of bees in the environment, created from spatial data (elevation, land cover...). 
This model describes the way bees explore the surroundings of selected origin point, when looking for food sources based on spatial data.  
Model can also be used to test possibility of American foulbrood (AFB) infection of bees through robbing in specified locations  

This model requires GAMA Platform software version 1.8 (  https://gama-platform.github.io/download)
Computation time takes 20 â€“ 30 minutes (may take about 50 min on low-end PCs)
The input files have been created and visualization of the results was performed in ArcGIS Desktop. 
(For user-own input files and visualization, ArcGIS desktop of similar software is required)

The downloaded  file (Bee-movement-in-the-environment-model--master.zip) should be placed in gama_workspace folder and extracted
The zip archive (project.zip) should be extracted as well to get .project file

Read Bee movement in the environment model manual before using or in case of any problems
For more detailed info about the model read ODD Protocol  

This model was created as part of the master thesis  Integration and practical use of spatial agent-based models
